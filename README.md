# domoticz-micropython-projects

## Purpose
To explore how to use the MicroPython programming language running on embedded hardware interfacing with the Domoticz Home Automation System.

The core of the projects uses the Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontroller, with components like actuators & sensors.
The microcontroller is acting as a web server to communicate with the Domoticz Home Automation System.

The intention is to provide some practical guidance, inspire ideas .. but not to explain Domoticz nor programming languages.

## Prerequisites
It is expected to have basic knowledge of 
* Domoticz Home Automation System
* Domoticz Automation Event system dzVents & Lua
* Programming languages Python and MicroPython
* Raspberry Pi Pico / Pico W and ESP microcontrollers
* Thonny Integrated Development Environment
* JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)

## Remarks
* This is a working document = conceptual changes & new idea’s whilst progressing.
* There might be better solutions = changes depend on the author’s learning curve.
* To-Do actions are tagged with [TODO] and captured in the file TODO.md.
* Hard- and Software versions are subject to change.
* Drawings are created with Fritzing.
* The sources are included in this document, but the latest sources can be found in the GitHub repository folder src.
