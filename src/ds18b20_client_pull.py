:description
The Pico W runs as a web server and listens to post request from clients (PULL).
If the post request is {"request":1} then the temperatures of the connected sensors are read.
The data is returned to the client as JSON object in Domoticz format:
{"status": "OK", "title": "{'request': 1}", "message": [{"id": 1, "temperature": 22.0, "address": "28FF5E1804150334"}, {"id": 2, "temperature": 17.4375, "address": "28330A9497040373"}]}
The key message contains an JSON array with the DS18B20 address and temperature.
Each DS18B20 has an unique 8-byte address, like 28 FF 5E 18 04 15 03 34.
The two DS18B20 sensors are:
* Keyes DS18B20 (address 28FF5E1804150334)
* Oumefar Digital Temperaturesensor DS18B20 (address 28330A9497040373)
:example
Using curl with HTTP response JSON object.
HTTP Request
curl -v -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"request\":1}" http://webserver-ip
HTTP Response
{"status": "OK", "title": "{'request': 1}", "message": [{"id": 1, "temperature": 22.0, "address": "28FF5E1804150334"}, {"id": 2, "temperature": 17.4375, "address": "28330A9497040373"}]}
:notes
Pico Breadboard Kit is used to wire up the DS18B20.
Configuration stored in config.py, ensure to upload to the picow.
DS18B20 measures every 60 seconds.
